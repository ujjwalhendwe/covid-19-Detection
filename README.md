# covid-19-Detection
A web app to Predict covid-19 from PA view of Chest X-ray using CNN

Project Name: COVID-19 DETECTION                                         

Name of the contributors: Ujjwal Hendwe & Anshika Verma

About the project: 

In the middle of a global pandemic, when everything seems confusing and uncertain, we made an attempt to make things a little easier. It is very important to keep an eye on the symptoms and to get ourselves diagnosed on time. When we go for a covid test we have to stand in long queues for hours which increases the chances of getting infected.

The motive of this project is to provide you with a facility that helps you to predict whether you are infected by covid or not at your home being in your comfort zone. All you have to do is to upload your PA view chest x-ray and that’s it, with a few clicks you’ll be able to predict the results with great accuracy. The basic yet informative interface of our website plays a vital role in eliminating the confusion and chaos. We provide great accuracy because of our highly analyzed ML model.

Project Repo: https://github.com/UAceIt-Winter-of-Mentorship/Covid-Detection

Technical Stacks used: Python, numpy, pandas, HTML, CSS, Javascript, flask, keras 

Site Map: Our site is only of one page hence we don’t need to make any site-map for it.

Week-wise progress in this mentorship program:
 Week 1:
 
     We learned about Python-Numpy,Pandas,flask
     
     We got familiar with how to access github,create a Github Repository , Commit new changes , and how to make pull requests on Github.
     
     We got familiar with Google Colab, learned how to create a google collab file, run a cell in file and install packages.
     
 Week 2:
 
     We started learning about deep learning, neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)
     
     Later, We started building our model. We used the following database for it https://bit.ly/3FSWMpQ 
     We evaluated and increased the model accuracy.
     
 Week 3:    
 
     We started creating a Backend for our project in Flask.
     
     We learned how to run an ML model using Flask.
     
     We also started creating frontends for this ML  based Web app.
     
     We integrated the frontend and backend and made a working web app.
     
Working of Web App: 
The web App takes an X-ray image as an Input and predicts it for Covid-19. 
The web page contains Light Mode and Dark Mode for better user experience. 

Test 1: Testing  Covid-19 Positive Image.(In Dark Mode) 

Step 1: choosing Image

Conclusion & Website link:

An overview of this project is that we have used the various
technical tools to build a user friendly website to predict covid-19 infection by using a PA view chest x-ray. For the prediction we used Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) Machine Learning Model while for our website we use HTML, CSS and Javascript and Flask.

Future Scope:

We can use this ML Model inbuilt with X-ray machines for quicker results.    
Accuracy of this model can be increased with use of modern Deep learning/Machine Learning Models using a comparatively larger dataset as compared to which is used in here. 

We can add a login function and can send personalized mail reports of the analysis of the X-ray and can link it with the Arogya-Setu App of the Indian Government for update of the Cases in India.
